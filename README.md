This is Work in Progress (WIP) to create a new frontpage for the Vala programming language.

## System Requirements

- [Node.js 10.13](https://nodejs.org) or higher
- Linux, Windows, or MacOS

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```sh
npm i
npm run dev
```

Open http://localhost:3000 with your preferred browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.tsx` or any file under the `components` folder.
