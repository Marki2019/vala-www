<h1>About Vala</h1>

## What is Vala?

Vala is an object-oriented programming language with a self-hosting compiler that generates C code and uses the GObject type system.

Vala supports modern language features such as:

- Interfaces
- Properties
- Signals
- Foreach statements
- Lambda expressions
- Type inferencing for local variables
- Generics
- Non-null types
- Assisted memory management
- Exception handling
- Type modules (Plugins)

## What kind of language is Vala?

### Productive

With Vala, you can get up and running quickly, thanks to convenient features like lambda expressions, exception handling, interfaces and generics.

### Performant

High-level features doesn't mean that there'll be memory overhead. Vala compiles to C code, so you get raw native performance without having to allocate memory yourself.

### Statically-Typed

Vala helps you write type-safe code without the verbosity, thanks to type inference.

### Integrative

Vala is designed to allow access to existing C libraries, especially GObject-based libraries, without the need for runtime bindings. All that is needed to use a library with Vala is an API file, containing the class and method declarations in Vala syntax. Vala currently comes with bindings for GLib and GTK+ and many others from the GNOME Platform.

### Familiar

The syntax of Vala is inspired by C# and Java, so if you have used either of those, you'll seamlessly adapt to writing Vala code.
