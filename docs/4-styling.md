# Styling

Sass files are stored under the `sass/` directory with the`.scss` file extension.

## Coding Style

- When writing Sass, try to use as little of Sass' features as possible. Avoiding these features keeps the codebase simple and makes it easier to maintain.

## Tips

- If you feel like you're writing a lot of Sass in one file, it's a good hint that you should split the code up into multiple files
- Rely on the [cascade](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Cascade). It will help keep your rule names simple.
- Add comments to rules/property changes that perform changes that can't be inferred from the properties being changed.
- When you have multiple related files, move them under a new directory to keep things organised and tidy.
